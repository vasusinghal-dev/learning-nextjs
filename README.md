# 📘 Learning Next.js

This repository documents my ongoing journey of learning **Next.js**.
Inside, you'll find topic-based folders — each containing **practice code**, **notes**, and **experiments** for the specific concept I'm studying.

I’m exploring a wide range of Next.js fundamentals and advanced features, including:

- App Router
- Routing & Navigation
- Server & Client Components
- Data Fetching (SSR, SSG, ISR)
- Layouts & Metadata
- API Routes
- Authentication
- Performance Optimization
- Database integrations & state management

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repo

This is a **learning sandbox**, not a polished showcase.
Every folder represents a topic I've learned, with hands-on examples to build real understanding.

## 📝 Notes

Expect practical examples, experiments, breakdowns, and explanations.
This repo will evolve as I continue mastering Next.js.
